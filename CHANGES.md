# WhatsApp Group Member Extractor - Changelog

## v7.0.0 - Headless Extraction (2025-12-28) 🚀

### 🎯 Major Feature: Invisible Extraction
Complete refactoring to execute all automation in a **hidden tab** (`active: false`) with **zero visual interference** in the user's active WhatsApp Web tab.

### ✨ What's New

#### 1. Headless Orchestration
- **Hidden Tab Worker**: All extraction happens in invisible background tab
- **Job State Machine**: 9-state lifecycle (IDLE → BOOTING_WORKER → WAITING_READY → CHECKING_SESSION → RUNNING → FINALIZING → DONE)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Hidden tab automatically closed on completion or error
- **Anti-Concurrency Lock**: Prevents multiple simultaneous extractions
- **Comprehensive Timeouts**: Safety timeouts for all stages

#### 2. WhatsApp Web State Detection
- **LOGIN_REQUIRED**: QR code or link device detection (multi-language)
- **CONNECTING**: Reconnecting or phone offline detection
- **READY**: Fully loaded and ready state
- **LOADING**: Initial page load state
- **Smart Retry**: Exponential backoff for connecting state (1s, 2s, 3.5s, 5s, 8s)

#### 3. User Experience
**What Users See:**
- ✅ Smooth progress bar (3% → 100%)
- ✅ Real-time member count
- ✅ Status messages
- ✅ Final results

**What Users DON'T See:**
- ❌ No text typing in visible tab
- ❌ No chats opening
- ❌ No scrolling
- ❌ No visual interference whatsoever

#### 4. Error Handling
Human-friendly error messages:
- 🔐 **LOGIN_REQUIRED**: "WhatsApp Web precisa ser conectado..."
- 📶 **CONNECTING_TIMEOUT**: "WhatsApp está conectando..."
- ⚠️ **WORKER_READY_TIMEOUT**: "Não foi possível inicializar..."
- ⏱️ **EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT**: "Extração demorou além do esperado..."
- 💥 **WORKER_CRASHED**: "Erro inesperado..."
- 🔒 **LOCKED**: "Já existe uma extração em andamento..."
- ❌ **CANCELLED**: "Extração cancelada"
- 📱 **NO_CHAT**: "Não foi possível abrir o chat..."

### 🛠️ Technical Changes

#### Background Script (`background/background.js`)
- Added headless orchestrator with complete job lifecycle
- Hidden tab creation with `chrome.tabs.create({ active: false })`
- Tab load waiting with `tabs.onUpdated` listener
- Message routing between UI, background, and worker tabs
- Comprehensive timeout handling for all stages
- Automatic resource cleanup in `finally` block

#### Content Script (`content/content.js`)
- Added HEADLESS_* message handlers (PING/PONG, CHECK_STATE, EXTRACT_GROUP, CANCEL)
- Implemented multi-language state detection (PT/EN/ES)
- Progress reporting to background script
- Reuses all existing extraction logic (zero changes to core)

#### Side Panel (`sidepanel.js`)
- Added `useHeadlessMode` flag (default: `true`)
- Background message listener for HEADLESS_* messages
- Headless extraction trigger method
- Error code to human message translation
- Backward compatibility maintained (legacy mode available)

#### Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- Version bump: `6.0.6` → `7.0.0`
- Added `tabs` permission for hidden tab management

### 📊 Message Contract

#### UI → Background
```javascript
START_HEADLESS_EXTRACTION { jobId, groupId, groupName, isArchived }
CANCEL_HEADLESS_EXTRACTION { jobId }
GET_STATUS { jobId }
```

#### Background → Worker
```javascript
HEADLESS_PING { jobId }
HEADLESS_CHECK_STATE { jobId }
HEADLESS_EXTRACT_GROUP { jobId, groupId, groupName, isArchived }
HEADLESS_CANCEL { jobId }
```

#### Worker → Background
```javascript
HEADLESS_PONG { jobId }
HEADLESS_CHECK_STATE_RESULT { jobId, state, reason }
HEADLESS_PROGRESS { jobId, percent, count, stage }
HEADLESS_DONE { jobId, members, meta }
HEADLESS_ERROR { jobId, code, message }
```

#### Background → UI
```javascript
HEADLESS_STATE { jobId, state, message }
HEADLESS_PROGRESS { jobId, percent, count, stage, statusText }
HEADLESS_DONE { jobId, members, meta }
HEADLESS_ERROR { jobId, code, message, recoverable }
```

### ⏱️ Timeout Configuration
- **Worker Boot**: 30 seconds
- **Worker Ready (Handshake)**: 20 seconds
- **Session Check**: 25 seconds
- **Total Extraction**: 8 minutes
- **Progress Stall**: 20 seconds
- **Connecting Retry Backoff**: 1s, 2s, 3.5s, 5s, 8s

### 🔒 Non-Regression Guarantees
- ✅ **NO changes** to `extractor-v6-optimized.js` (reused as-is)
- ✅ **NO changes** to `inject.js` (reused as-is)
- ✅ **NO changes** to core extraction logic
- ✅ All existing features preserved (exports, history, virtual scroll, IndexedDB)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (legacy mode available via flag)

### 📈 Performance
Expected extraction times:
- **Small groups** (<50 members): 10-20 seconds
- **Medium groups** (50-200 members): 30-60 seconds
- **Large groups** (200-500 members): 1-3 minutes
- **Very large groups** (500+ members): 3-8 minutes

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- ✅ Extraction 100% invisible to user
- ✅ No visual interference in active tab
- ✅ Progress updates work smoothly
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ Cleanup always happens (success or error)
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ Professional UX

### 🧪 Testing
Complete test plan includes:
1. Basic headless extraction (happy path)
2. WhatsApp not logged in (LOGIN_REQUIRED)
3. WhatsApp connecting (retry logic)
4. Concurrent extraction prevention
5. Large group extraction
6. Archived group extraction
7. Cleanup on success
8. Cleanup on error
9. Backward compatibility (legacy mode)
10. State recovery after reload
